# PythonTwitterBotTemplate
The basics of creating your own Python-based Twitter bot are at your very fingertips. No longer do you need unnecessarily long step-by-step guides from Reddit. 
You just need basic Python knowledge, a Twitter Dev account, and a little bit of imagination.

## Usage
This template can be used for a variety of purposes such as autmoated tweets, Twitter accounts meant for advertisments, or Twitter accounts meant for buisness.
However, this template must be used while maintaining the Twitter Terms of Service.
Any act that violates these terms is not permitted.
You will need a Twitter Developer Account, which is where you will find your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret Key, Access Key, and Access Secret Key.

## Editing
While this template can be changed however you desire, there are some main components that need to be adjusted if you want to use this bot "straight out of the box".

Here is a list of variables that are essential to the bot, meant to be changed, and can be changed easily.

hoursBetweenTweet = The amount of time between each Twitter post, measured in hours.

CONSUMER_KEY = Your Twitter Developer Account Consumer Key must be written here as a string, or the bot will not work.

CONSUMER_SECRET = Your Twitter Developer Account Consumer Secret Key must be written here as a string, or the bot will not work.

ACCESS_KEY = Your Twitter Developer Account Access Key must be written here as a string, or the bot will not work.

ACCESS_SECRET = Your Twitter Developer Account Access Secret Key must be written here as a string, or the bot will not work.

postThis = This is meant to be equal to the function of which the return value is meant to be tweeted. It is not recommended to change this, as it is easier to edit the twitterPost() function rather than create a seperate function. However, you may do what you will.
